* Hello everyone, my name is Teemo. Happy to see you all here!
* Today we are going to talk about the analytics of news applications.
* I work as a datajournalist at Yle. We have a team called PlusDesk and together with other news desks we create the special content for the web.
* Special in this context means everything that our CMS can't handle. We make interactive maps, "Snow fall" stories, calculators, tests, infographics, services.

# Event tracking: 3 show cases

* CandiDate
* The Story of a Village
* Finns are getting older

# 3, three, /θriː/

???

* Election machine where event tracking showed us that what we did was a success.
* A feature story where we want to decide what kind of layout we should choose.
* Data tool where we saw what works and what should be changed.

---

class: left, top
# Case #1: [CandiDate](http://yle.fi/uutiset/7869067)
* Election machine for the Finnish parlamentary election.
* Build specially to work on mobile and to be, quick and fun to use.
* Targeted for the younger audience. *Gate theory to politics*

Our goal was to get **100,000 page views**.

<img src="http://img.yle.fi/uutiset/eduskuntavaalit_2015/article7875320.ece/ALTERNATES/w480h270/kandideitti%20kasi%20puhelin" style="width: 250px"/>

???

* Lets take a look at the application.
* OK But what happened!

---

class: left, top
# Case #1: [CandiDate](http://yle.fi/uutiset/7869067)
* According to Google Analytics we got about 50,000 page views. Far less than the goal 100,000.
* In addition to page views we monitored events, likes swipes, matches, use of filters.
* Swipes were made over 2,000,000 times.

&rarr; One indicator stated a failure, but another shows it was a success.

```javascript
app.on('swipe', function () {
  if (typeof _gaq !== 'undefined') {
    _gaq.push(['_trackEvent', '7869067 - Candidate', 'Event', 'Swipe']);
  }
});
```

???

* It was important that we monitored more than just one indicator.
* People were very keen to use it.
* The people who used it found it very useful.

CandiDate is also nominee in Noda Awards in mobile category.

#Case #2: [The Story of a Village](http://yle.fi/uutiset/8698926)
* Visual multimedia story with videos, photos, graphics and text.
* Long news article
  - 30,730 characters.
* Content had 7 different chapters.
  - Should we publish 7 different articles with different urls.
  - Or should we divide the story in different pages.

???

* Lets take a look at the story.
* Usually I see that there kind of stories use pagination or they are divided into chapters.

---

class: left, top
# Case #2: [The Story of a Village](http://yle.fi/uutiset/8698926)
According to analytics a scrollable layout has proven to be the best way to provide this kind of long content.

* 82% scrolled to ingress
* 66% scrolled to chapter 1
* 53% scrolled to chapter 2
* 46% ...
* 42% 
* 40%
* 39%
* 37% scrolled to chapter 7

???

* Our data shows that we loose a large porpotion of the audience upon a click.

# Case #3 [Finns are getting older](http://yle.fi/uutiset/7787729)

* Dataset of people under 19 and over 65 years.
* Data for every district from 1975 to 2013.
* We built a tool to visualize this data.


???

* Lets take a look at what it looks like.
* The problem is always when you are creating these kind of data applications is that you have to tailor it somehow and sometimes you don't get the interface right.
* Event tracking shows you were you've gone wrong and you can fix it.

---

# Case #3 [Finns are getting older](http://yle.fi/uutiset/7787729)

But you don't always get it right :(

* We noticed one feature was barely utilized at all.
* We made an immitiate yet simple change.

Conversion rate got up.

???

* We have also noticed that some extra features that we have built have not been used.
* And after that we have learnt that in a single story we should focus on delivering just the main message.

# Why should we care about analytics

* We want to **make data-driven decisions!!!**
  * Improve usability
  * Increase engagement
  * Increase conversion
  * Improve internal goals
* We want to understand our audiences better.
* What solutions work, which don't.

???

* Improvements based on data, not guesses.
* Actual best practices based on previous findings.
